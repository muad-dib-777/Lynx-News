# Lynx-News
A news app built using React that will fetch news headlines from various sources with the help of the News API

The app was hosted locally, since the News API does not allow professional hosting without upgrading to a paid subscription

The News API requires an API key, which was kept in .env.local in this case. This file needs to be created and the unique API key needs to be added before the app can be used
